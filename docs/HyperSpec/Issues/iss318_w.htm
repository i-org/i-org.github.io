<H2>Issue SHARPSIGN-PLUS-MINUS-PACKAGE Writeup</H2>

<B>Category:</B>     CLARIFICATION/CHANGE<P>
<B>Edit history:</B> Version 1 by Pitman   01-Mar-87<P>
              Version 2 by Masinter 10-Nov-87<P>
              Version 3 by Masinter 14-Nov-87<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
No information is provided in the description of #+ and #- (pp. 358-359) about<P>
what package the features are read on.<P>
<P>
In some systems, the current package is used. Since there is no wording in CLtL<P>
to the contrary, it's reasonable to assume that this would be done, but a<P>
consequence of this is that you must be much more sensitive to the package<P>
you're in at any given time when using #+ or #- even for system-provided<P>
features. (This is a problem if the LISP package can contain only the symbols in<P>
CLtL because system-provided features will likely not have the names of symbols<P>
on LISP and hence will <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_provid.htm#require"><B>require</B></A> package prefixes. Having a symbol named<P>
LISP:SYMBOLICS or LISP:LUCID would not be possible, so something like<P>
#+Symbolics would not be possible; you'd have to write #+SYSTEM:SYMBOLICS or<P>
some such, which might get a read error in a non-Symbolics implementation that<P>
didn't <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_export.htm#export"><B>export</B></A> SYMBOLICS from SYSTEM...)<P>
<P>
In some systems, a canonical package (such as <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/t_kwd.htm#keyword"><B>KEYWORD</B></A>) is used. This means that<P>
package prefixes are rarely necessary in sharpsign conditionals for<P>
system-provided features regardless of the current package or restrictions about<P>
what may be in LISP. (For example, the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/t_kwd.htm#keyword"><B>KEYWORD</B></A> package can have any symbol so<P>
it's not a problem to push :SYMBOLICS or :LUCID on <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A>).<P>
<P>
This has implications about what goes on the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A>  list (p. 448).<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (SHARPSIGN-PLUS-MINUS-PACKAGE:KEYWORD):<P>
</B><P>
Specify that the default package while reading feature specs is the keyword<P>
package. Other packages may be designated by use of explicit package prefixes.<P>
<P>
Symbols on <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> may be in any package but  that in practice they will<P>
mostly be on the keyword package because that's the package #+/#- uses by<P>
default. If symbols in a package other than keyword appear on <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A>, they<P>
will be seen by #+/#- only if marked by explicit package  prefixes in the<P>
written feature-spec.<P>
<P>
Clarify that the package of the IEEE-FLOATING-POINT symbol mentioned on p. 448<P>
is <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/t_kwd.htm#keyword"><B>KEYWORD</B></A>.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
Making the behavior of #+ and #- well defined is important for people writing<P>
portable code that manipulate <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> directly.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
Some implementations bind <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_pkg.htm#STpackageST"><B>*PACKAGE*</B></A> while reading feature specs and others do<P>
not.<P>
<P>
<B>Adoption Cost:<P>
</B><P>
Changes to implementations to make them conform should be fairly minor if not<P>
trivial.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
As currently specified, using #+ and #- in truly portable code can have<P>
bootstrapping problems, since it is sometimes required to conditionally set up<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> in different ways for different systems.<P>
<P>
<B>Conversion Cost:<P>
</B><P>
Few changes to user code will be required; code that uses #+ and #- will<P>
continue to work, although code that manipulates <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> directly may <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_provid.htm#require"><B>require</B></A><P>
editing. <P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
Most users would perceive this as a bug fix either to CLtL or to certain<P>
implementations.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
The cleanup committee supports this proposal.<P>
<P>
It might be reasonable to suggest that only vendors should add keyword symbols<P>
to the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/v_featur.htm#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> list, and that users should add features on their personal<P>
packages so that collisions due to user applications were less likely. This idea<P>
might be a subject of controversy though, so is not part of this proposal.<P>
<P>
It would be useful to create a non-binding registry of feature names (and<P>
package names) already in use, so that Lisp implementors could pick otherwise<P>
unused feature names, and users who wanted to write portable code could know<P>
what feature names were preferred.<P>
