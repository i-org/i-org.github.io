<H2>Issue COLON-NUMBER Writeup</H2>

<PRE><B>Issue:</B>        <A HREF="iss055.htm">COLON-NUMBER</A><P>
<B>References:</B>   Parsing of Numbers and Symbols (p339-341, 343-344)<P>
<B>Category:</B>     CLARIFICATION<P>
<B>Edit history:</B> 22-Oct-87, Version 1 by Pitman<P>
<B>Status:</B>	      For Internal Discussion<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
  CLtL is unclear about whether a colon followed by a potential number<P>
  is a potential number. There are passages which seem to address this<P>
  issue unambiguously but fail.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (COLON-NUMBER:UNDEFINED):<P>
</B><P>
  Clarify that syntax involving a leading colon followed by a potential<P>
  number is not well-defined. That is, use of notation such as :1, :1/2,<P>
  and :2^3 in a position where an expression appropriate for <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/f_rd_rd.htm#read"><B>READ</B></A> is<P>
  expected is an error.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
  This makes the status quo apparent.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
  Some implementations, such as Symbolics Lisp, claim the right to <P>
  interpret this as an ``is an error'' situation where their<P>
  upward-compatible extension is to parse ``:1'' as the number 1<P>
  (incidentally, but uninterestingly, expressed in the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/t_kwd.htm#keyword"><B>KEYWORD</B></A> package).<P>
<P>
  Other implementations tokenize ``:1'' as a single token, identify it<P>
  as a symbol, and then parse it as :\1 would be parsed.<P>
<P>
<B>Adoption Cost:<P>
</B><P>
  None. This clarification forces no implementations to change.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
  Programmer expectations that any useful behavior can be portably relied<P>
  upon in this pathological case should be soundly trounced.<P>
<P>
<B>Conversion Cost:<P>
</B><P>
  Slight. Some users may have mistakenly believed that this was an aspect<P>
  of the language that was guaranteed and may have written programs that<P>
  exploited that belief. Such incidences are probably very rare, however.<P>
  Also, even in the few cases where such code fortuitously worked,<P>
  implementations are likely to continue to support it so such code will<P>
  probably continue to fortuitously work in many of those rare situations.<P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
  Arguably a slight improvement in visual aesthetics. What was already <P>
  a pretty marginal syntax is discouraged.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
  Pitman supports this clarification. He thinks this issue is not a big<P>
  deal, but it does crop up often enough to be a nuisance. It would be<P>
  nice to have everyone acknowledge a unified position, even if that only<P>
  meant agreeing to disagree.<P>
